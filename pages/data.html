		<h1>Data</h1>

		<p>
			We planned to use part of the dataset found in Kaggle, by filtering those Hip-Hop songs. There are 
			around 380,000+ lyrics in the original data set, and there will be about thousands Hip-Hop songs among 
			them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The structure is: 
		</p>
		<p>
			[index]: the unique integer to tag each song, will be reassigned after filtering; 
		</p>
		<p>
			[song]: string, the song’s name, words are connected by “-”;  
		</p>
		<p>
			[year]: integer, the year when the song was released; 
		</p>
		<p>
			[artist]: string, the artist’s name, words are connected by “-”;
		</p>
		<p>
			[genre]: string, equals “Hip-Hop” after filtering; 
		</p>
		<p>
			[lyrics]: string, the lyrics of each song, sepearted by lines, empty value will be deleted from the 
			filtered dataset.
